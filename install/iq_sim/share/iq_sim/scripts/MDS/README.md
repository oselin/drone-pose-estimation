# MultiDimensional Scaling Python library (MDS)

This is a simple library which implements the MultiDimensional Scaling (MDS) algorithm for unmanned vehicles, both aerial and terrestrial.

It can be easily imported with the command

```python

from  UAV import *
```

In the ```examples``` folder some examples of 2D and 3D environments as well as the usage of the library can be found

In the ```docs``` there can be found some academic research and the implementation of the algorithm in **Maple** (algebraic manipulation) 

Enjoy!
