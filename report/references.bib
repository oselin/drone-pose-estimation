	abstract = {Ultra-wideband ({UWB}) wireless technology has seen an increased penetration in the robotics field as a robust localization method in recent years. {UWB} enables high accuracy distance estimation from time-of-flight measurements of wireless signals, even in non-line-of-sight measurements. {UWB}-based localization systems have been utilized in various types of {GNSS}-denied environments for ground or aerial autonomous robots. However, most of the existing solutions rely on a fixed and well-calibrated set of {UWB} nodes, or anchors, to estimate accurately the position of other mobile nodes, or tags, through multilateration. This limits the applicability of such systems for dynamic and ad-hoc deployments, such as post-disaster scenarios where the {UWB} anchors could be mounted on mobile robots to aid the navigation of {UAVs} or other robots. We introduce a collaborative algorithm for online autocalibration of anchor positions, enabling not only ad-hoc deployments but also movable anchors, based on Decawave's {DWM}1001 {UWB} module. Compared to the built-in autocalibration process from Decawave, we drastically reduce the amount of calibration time and increase the accuracy at the same time. We provide both experimental measurements and simulation results to demonstrate the usability of this algorithm.},

Main advances stemming both from complex system architectures as well as powerful embedded computing and communication platforms, advanced sensing and networking protocols have been leveraged to prove the viability of this concept. The design of suitable algorithms for data processing, communication and control across previously disparate domains has thus currently become an intensive area of interdisciplinary research. The paper was focused on the collaborative aspects of {UAV}–{WSN} systems and the reference papers were analyzed from this point of view, on each functional module. The paper offers a timely review of recent advances in this area of critical interest with focus on a comparative perspective across multiple recent theoretical and applied contributions. A systematic approach is carried out in order to structure a unitary from conceptual design towards key implementation aspects. Focus areas are identified and discussed such as distributed data processing algorithms, hierarchical multi-protocol networking aspects and high level {WSN}–constrained {UAV}-control. Application references are highlighted in various domains such as environmental, agriculture, emergency situations and homeland security. Finally, a research agenda is outlined to advance the field towards tangible economic and social impact.},

	abstract = {Small unmanned aerial vehicles ({UAV}) have penetrated multiple domains over the past years. In {GNSS}-denied or indoor environments, aerial robots require a robust and stable localization system, often with external feedback, in order to fly safely. Motion capture systems are typically utilized indoors when accurate localization is needed. However, these systems are expensive and most require a fixed setup. Recently, visual-inertial odometry and similar methods have advanced to a point where autonomous {UAVs} can rely on them for localization. The main limitation in this case comes from the environment, as well as in long-term autonomy due to accumulating error if loop closure cannot be performed efficiently. For instance, the impact of low visibility due to dust or smoke in post-disaster scenarios might render the odometry methods inapplicable. In this paper, we study and characterize an ultra-wideband ({UWB}) system for navigation and localization of aerial robots indoors based on Decawave's {DWM}1001 {UWB} node. The system is portable, inexpensive and can be battery powered in its totality. We show the viability of this system for autonomous flight of {UAVs}, and provide open-source methods and data that enable its widespread application even with movable anchor systems. We characterize the accuracy based on the position of the {UAV} with respect to the anchors, its altitude and speed, and the distribution of the anchors in space. Finally, we analyze the accuracy of the self-calibration of the anchors' positions.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.10255},
	shorttitle = {Land \& Localize},
	abstract = {Relative localization is a crucial functional block of any robotic swarm. We address it in a fleet of nano-drones characterized by a 10 cm-scale form factor, which makes them highly versatile but also strictly limited in their onboard power envelope. State-of-the-Art solutions leverage Ultra-{WideBand} ({UWB}) technology, allowing distance range measurements between peer nano-drones and a stationary infrastructure of multiple {UWB} anchors. Therefore, we propose an {UWB}-based infrastructure-free nano-drones swarm, where part of the fleet acts as dynamic anchors, i.e., anchor-drones ({ADs}), capable of automatic deployment and landing. By varying the Ads' position constraint, we develop three alternative solutions with different trade-offs between flexibility and localization accuracy. In-field results, with four flying mission-drones ({MDs}), show a localization root mean square error ({RMSE}) spanning from 15.3 cm to 27.8 cm, at most. Scaling the number of {MDs} from 4 to 8, the {RMSE} marginally increases, i.e., less than 10 cm at most. The power consumption of the {MDs}' {UWB} module amounts to 342 {mW}. Ultimately, compared to a fixed-infrastructure commercial solution, our infrastructure-free system can be deployed anywhere and rapidly by taking 5.7 s to self-localize 4 {ADs} with a localization {RMSE} of up to 12.3\% in the most challenging case with 8 {MDs}.},
